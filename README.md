# üìà AI Financial Analyst Assistant

This project is a powerful, multi-agent financial analysis tool built using CrewAI and Streamlit. It takes a company name or stock ticker, orchestrates a team of AI agents to gather and analyze data from various sources, and presents a comprehensive financial report through an easy-to-use web interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Web UI**: A clean and simple user interface built with Streamlit.
- **Ticker Search**: Automatically finds the correct stock ticker for a given company name using the Alpha Vantage API. It can even handle ambiguity by letting the user choose from multiple matches.
- **Company Profiling**: Gathers essential company information, including its business summary, sector, industry, and website.
- **In-depth Financial Analysis**:
    - Fetches the latest annual financial statements (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) from Yahoo Finance.
    - Calculates key financial ratios like Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Debt-to-Equity, and Current Ratio.
    - Provides a summary of the company's financial health.
- **Stock Performance Review**: Analyzes the stock's historical performance over the last year, highlighting highs, lows, and recent prices.
- **News & Sentiment Analysis**: Scans recent news and press releases for the company using the Serper API and determines the overall sentiment.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: A final agent synthesizes all the gathered information into a well-structured and easy-to-read report in Markdown format.
- **API Caching**: Implements caching for financial data API calls to improve performance and avoid redundant requests.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The AI Crew

The application leverages [CrewAI] to simulate a team of specialized AI agents, each with a specific role. The process is sequential, with the output of one task often forming the context for the next.

1.  **Company Identifier Agent**: Takes the user's input and uses the `TickerSearchTool` to find the correct stock ticker.
2.  **Lead Company Researcher Agent**: Uses the identified ticker to fetch general company information with the `CompanyInfoTool`.
3.  **Quantitative Financial Analyst Agent**: Analyzes financial statements obtained via the `CompanyFinancialsTool` and calculates key ratios.
4.  **Stock Performance Analyst Agent**: Fetches and summarizes the 1-year stock history using the `HistoricalStockDataTool`.
5.  **Market News Interpreter Agent**: Gathers and analyzes recent news sentiment using the `SerperDevTool`.
6.  **Chief Financial Reporter Agent**: Consolidates all the findings into the final, structured report.
